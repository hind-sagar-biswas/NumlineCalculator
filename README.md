# Numberline Calculator

NumLine (number line) Calculator is a website that aims to provide a clear and simple way of understanding mathematical calculations. It is designed for anyone who wants to learn more about the logic and mechanics of math. It has **three main objectives:**

1. To `simplify mathematical calculations` and show how they actually work. The website explains the rules and properties of different operations and how they apply to various situations.
2. To prove that all and every `calculation can be done with just addition`. The website demonstrates that subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, decimals, and even negative numbers can all be derived from adding positive integers. It shows how this is possible and why it is relevant for understanding math.
3. To `visualize the calculation` process in their simplest form. The website uses number line to calculate and show how the calculation is done. The number line is an effective tool that helps users see the magnitude and direction of numbers and how they change when operations are performed on them.

Number Line Calculator is a website that strives to make math accessible and enjoyable for everyone. It invites users to explore and discover new things about math. It also welcomes any questions or feedback from users. Please feel free to contact us for any inquiries or suggestions. Thank you for visiting Number Line Calculator.

## Structure

This is a **Module based application**

### Flow

`Form > Get Expression > Parse Expression > Simplify > Operate > Show on Numberline`

1. First render the form.
2. The value caught from the form submission is parsed.
3. The expression is simplified.
4. It is then sent through `Operator` to get the movements and results.
5. The movements are then shown on numberline via rendering.
