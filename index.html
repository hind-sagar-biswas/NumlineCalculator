                    <p>NumLine (number line) Calculator is a website that aims to provide a clear and simple way of understanding
                        mathematical
                        calculations. It is designed for anyone who wants to learn more about the logic and mechanics of math. It has three
                        main
                        objectives: </p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>To simplify mathematical calculations and show how they actually work. The website explains the rules and
                            properties
                            of
                            different operations and how they apply to various situations.</li>
                        <li>To prove that all and every calculation can be done with just addition. The website demonstrates that
                            subtraction,
                            multiplication, division, fractions, decimals, and even negative numbers can all be derived from adding positive
                            integers. It shows how this is possible and why it is relevant for understanding math.</li>
                        <li>To visualize the calculation process in their simplest form. The website uses number line to calculate and show
                            how
                            the
                            calculation is done. The number line is an effective tool that helps users see the magnitude and direction of
                            numbers
                            and how they change when operations are performed on them.</li>
                    </ul>
